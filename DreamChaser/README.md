# Group 5 - Website Creation
## Project's title: 
# DreamChaser


## Project description:
It’s a platform that serves Chinese students who want to apply for French Business schools. The main reason why we created such a startup is that in China, it is difficult for Chinese students to get more information and professional guidance apart from some official channels. And compared with western students, studying abroad could be a dream. That’s how the name DreamChaser came. The DreamChaser platform works by connecting experienced tutors and students directly. 

Our goal is to deliver a students-centered website, which is young, efficient, intuitive and user-friendly.  

# Website structure:
Home page, Schools introduction page, Tutors introduction page, Tutors profile page, Cart page, Contact us page.

# Customer journey:
- A friend recommended DreamChaser to look for some professional advice.
- At first glance, he was impressed by the 2022 results and successful stories. 
- He started to have a closer look at those top French business schools one by one. He was quite interested in Essec because of the flexibility it offers. 
- Before he decided to apply for which school to apply for, he would like to discuss with a tutor, who graduated from ESSEC. Li believed xx could be a good option. 
- However he didn’t see a service like general consulting. He then tried to ask for more info and price by sending a message through contact us. 
- Received message from DreamChaser, saying that he can add a mock interview in the cart and the platform will do the communication. He added a mock interview in the cart and checkout.
